# Python_practice

This folder keeps some python practice codes of myself.

Now it has:

  postcodes.py
  
  It is a chunk of python code calls a web API about postcode (without authentication key).
  It is written only to practise python coding.
  To run this code, it will first let you input a postcode and verify whether it is a real one.
  Then it will return some information about that postcode, such as country, region and some postcodes around it.
